          <h1>Placeholder Tagline</h1>
          <p>Violent extremist groups use the Internet to radicalize and recruit. We believe that the existing inventory of online videos along with advertising tools can be used to divert potential sympathizers away from the online recruiting efforts of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) and similar groups. This is a blueprint for how to do so, based on two recent pilot campaigns that together reached an estimate of 440,000 individuals seeking to engage with content promoting violent Islamism.</p>

          <h1>Placeholder Tagline</h1>
          <p>ISIS is a terrorist group to has “taken territory” in both the physical and digital spheres. ISIS places a high premium on public messaging to advance its objectives, thus setting up central media outlets for its messaging. All of this forms a complex network of content and actors whose goal is to leverage the power of the Internet to promote violent extremism. The Rami Method is a new approach to tackling violent extremism recruitment efforts online.</p>

          <h1>What is the Rami Method?</h1>
          <p>The Rami Method is a 4-step experiment that employs readily available online resources — existing online videos and targeted advertising tools — to counter ISIS recruitment efforts online, in an engaging, transparent and responsible way.</p>
          <h2>Four guiding principles have shaped this project and made it different from other initiatives underway: </h2>

          <h2>Focus on those who are the most susceptible to ISIS’ messaging</h2>
          <p>We envisioned the slice of ISIS’ audience that was most susceptible to the group’s message and actively seeking to engage with ISIS-produced content. We started by speaking directly to those who had been recruited and convinced by ISIS rhetoric. Our main principle in developing a way to reach our target audience was ensuring people’s privacy: nothing in this experiment involves monitoring user data. Our targeting strategy therefore relied on using curated, effffective keywords to engage our audience online.</p>

          <h2>Meet your audience where they are, Not where you think they should be</h2>
          <p>Our campaign should be engaging, and never give our audience the feeling of being confronted by a preachy and agenda-driven content. This principle guided us across all stages of designing and implementing the pilot: in the video selection, the draftfting of advertisement text, the creation of the visual identity of the video channels, etc.</p>

          <h2>The most authentic and credible content is already out there</h2>
          <p>Our experiment did not aim to create new “anti-ISIS” content, or to rely on content produced by governments for the purpose of fighting ISIS’ messaging online. Rather, we sought out material uploaded by individuals and civil society organizations, and we found that citizens’ testimonies, reports, and religious debates served as the most credible and legitimate voices.</p>

          <h2>Openness &amp; transparency will allow to improve and scale</h2>
          <p>Our experiment was not designed to develop a definitive “how-to” guide, but rather to begin a collaborative process whereby those engaging ISIS and affiliated groups online can learn from one another and build on each other’s successes. We are releasing the story of our experiment, the data, and the blueprint of how to replicate the project. We leave it to others to build upon, continue the conversation, and improve this approach.</p>

          <h1>The Team</h1>
          <p>Creating content, conducting research, running advertising campaigns, doing analytics: these are different areas of expertise that typically reside within distinct organizations. This Pilot has involved four researchers, videos from 83 different content creators (33 in English and 50 in Arabic), two lead partners, one market research firm and one technology incubator. We believe this model is particularly powerful.</p>
