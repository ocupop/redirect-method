        <h1>The pilot experiment that started it all.</h1>
        <p>
          The Redirect Method is a pilot project we conducted between August 2015 and March 2016 to test a new approach to tackling violent extremism recruitment efforts online. The project relied on two advertising campaigns of 5 YouTube playlists each: the English campaign featured 51 videos, and the Arabic campaign 65 videos. Over the course of 8 weeks, together these two campaigns reached an estimate of 320,906 unique individuals. This section describes the four steps we followed to build and deploy the Pilot: research, curation, targeting &amp; measurement.
