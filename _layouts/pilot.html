        <h1>The pilot experiment that started it all.</h1>
        <p>User: Ayda is a pilot experiment we conducted between August 2015 and March 2016 to test a new approach to tackling violent extremism recruitment efforts online. The project relied on two advertising campaigns of 5 YouTube playlist each: the English campaign featured 51 videos, and the Arabic campaign # videos. Over the course of 8 weeks, together these two campaigns reached an estimate of 440,000 unique individuals.</p>
