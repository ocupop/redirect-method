            <h3><i>How can we measure the performance of the campaign? What does data tell us about which bits and pieces are the most effective?</i></h3>
            <h2><em>What did we do?</em></h2>
            <p>Analytics and measurement help us gauge the performance of the campaigns, and their impact on users. We chose to track metrics that will tell us how many people our campaigns reached, if our content successfully engaged the target audience, and what were the most and least successful elements of our experiment.</p>
            <p><i>Our main requirement for measurement was to only use readily available metrics that did not infringe on users’ privacy, and that others could easily collect when running similar campaigns: we hope that this will lead to others sharing similar data, building benchmarks, and sharing best practices to optimize campaigns. We used campaign metrics provided by AdWords, and Youtube Analytics, along with third party research vendor Tubular Labs who were offering methodologies to measure impact by looking at the public comments under the YouTube videos included in the campaign.</i></p>

            <p>We used metrics to answer these simple questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>How many people from our target audience did the campaigns reach?</strong> These are called Reach metrics.</li>
              <li><strong>Did they watch the videos, and engage with the playlists?</strong> These are called Engagement metrics and they help us understand if we managed to make our campaign relevant and engaging for the target audience, or if they just glanced over it and moved on to other online activities.</li>
            </ul>

            

            <h2><em>What did we learn?</em></h2>
            <p><strong class="text-uppercase">REACH |</strong> The reach of most awareness campaigns is gauged by the number of unique users who ‘saw’ the ads. Because in this pilot our goal was not just awareness, but actual engagement, we chose to measure the reach of our campaigns by the number of unique users who ‘clicked’ on the ads, not just ‘saw’ them.</p>
            <p><img id="campaign-engagement" src="/uploads/graphic-results01.svg" class="img-responsive"></p>
            <p>The campaigns reached an estimate of 320,906 Unique Users who chose to click on our ads across the different touchpoints of the campaign: Search, Google Display Network, and YouTube: Est. 263,001 unique clickers from the Arabic campaign, and est. 57,905 unique clickers from the English campaign.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-uppercase">ENGAGEMENT |</strong> <span class="info" data-toggle="tooltip">Click Through Rate</span> is one of the most widely used online advertising metrics to gauge campaigns’ engagement. It’s a ratio showing how often people who see an ad end up clicking it.</p>
            <p><img id="campaign-engagement" src="/uploads/graphic-results02.svg" class="img-responsive"></p>
            <p>Average CTRs vary widely according to the industry of campaign, type of ad, precision of targeting, overall campaign objectives, and many other factors. The average Search CTR of all ads that ran against similar search terms in the 12 months prior to pilot launch was 2.41% for Arabic-language, and 1.73% for English language: these metrics can serve as a potential benchmark to evaluate our Search CTR.</p>

            <h3><em>What did this data teach us about our methodology?</em></h3>
            <p><strong>We reached our target audience.</strong><br>Some of the comments our video ads received showed that we reached users who harbour strong positive sentiment towards ISIS.</p>
            <p><img id="campaign-engagement" src="/uploads/graphic-results03.svg" class="img-responsive"></p>
            <p><strong>Targeting using keywords works.</strong><br>An analysis comparing average CTRs of different categories of search terms showed that users searching for official ISIS content in Arabic (eg. Dabiq magazine, Furqan Media, Amaq news..etc) had much higher engagement (~9.21% CTR) vs. overall campaigns average (4.3% CTR). While in English language campaigns users searching for terms related to ‘how to join’ ISIS delivered exceptionally higher engagement (~14.56% CTR) vs overall campaigns average (3.05% CTR).</strong></p>
            <p><img id="campaign-engagement" src="/uploads/graphic-results04.svg" class="img-responsive"></p>
            <p><strong>Narratives resulted in more engagement</strong><br>The English language playlist dedicated to refuting ISIS’s religious legitimacy narrative delivered an average time of 2:21 vs 1:55 overall average time in playlist average for all English language playlist. In Arabic, the playlist dedicated to directly refuting the ‘call to jihad’ narrative delivered an average time of 8:21 vs 3:32 for overall Arabic playlists.</p>
