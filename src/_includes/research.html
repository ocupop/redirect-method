            <h2><em>Which online videos effectively discredit ISIS, and violent Islamism more generally, to an audience of potential sympathizers?</em></h2>
            <h1>What did we do?</h1>
            <p>ISIS reaches a broad audience online&mdash;we focused our research on a slice of ISIS&rsquo;s audience that appeared particularly susceptible to the group&rsquo;s messaging. Our starting point was interviewing ISIS defectors and once-aspiring &lsquo;jihadi brides&rsquo; to glean insights into our users&rsquo; online browsing behavior. We then commissioned researchers with expertise in ISIS media to identify key recruitment narratives and surface online videos that effectively discredit these narratives. These counter-extremism videos were sourced from 83 different YouTube creators.</p>
            <p>We worked with several research partners with knowledge of ISIS&rsquo;s worldview and online materials to do two things:</p>

              <h1>What did we find?</h1>
              <p>We found an abundance of videos to support our project and our focus of the research was on seeking out videos that were objective in appearance --including documentaries or citizen journalism that portray the world as the creators found it--rather than materials that appeared specifically designed to counter ISIS. To get there, we used keyword searches to identify &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; counter-argument content -- that is, videos that are not necessarily well known, and often not designed explicitly to refute ISIS.</p>

              <p>We looked for voices that will convey a sense of credibility and authenticity to our target audience. We determined that, given our specific goals and audience in mind, four major categories of credible, authentic voices existed</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <div class="editable">
                  <p><strong>Citizen Journalism Videos</strong> News content created by members of the general population. This includes videos by those who reside in ISIS-controlled territory who document ISIS’s atrocities and failed governance efforts.</p>
                </div>
              </li>

                <div class="editable">
                  <p><strong>Documentary Footage</strong> Content produced by documentarians and journalists. This material can, for example, highlight the poor quality of life in the caliphate, and draw attention to the group’s violence against civilians.</p>

                  <p><strong>ISIS Defectors</strong> Videos highlighting the testimonies of ISIS defectors whose actual experiences undercut ISIS’s recruitment narratives, and reveal the group’s shortcomings and hypocrisy.</p>

              <p>The above categories are not alone in contradicting ISIS&rsquo;s message. These voices became our focus because they seem to be the most credible to the specific audience segment we want to reach. For example, one genre we did not include in our Pilot was parody. Satire appeals to those predisposed to seeing ISIS as an object of ridicule, but not to our target audience.</p><p><em><em>All information sources do not carry equal weight.</em></em></p><p>We learned from interviews with ISIS defectors and failed aspirants &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; that all information sources do not carry equal weight. For example, one British teenager recounted her first memory of ISIS: &ldquo;It was on the BBC, and I can't trust the BBC. If the BBC are saying this about them, I thought that it must be the opposite.&rdquo; Media created by governments or Western news outlets can be rejected on face value for a perception of promoting an anti-Muslim agenda.</p><p><em>Campaigns to confront online extremism don&rsquo;t necessitate new content creation.</em></p><p>The best part of the research&mdash;beyond identifying ISIS&rsquo;s recruiting narratives and the content categories most likely to debunk them&mdash;was that it surfaced hundreds of online videos in English and Arabic that were already uploaded to YouTube, and that would not be be rejected outright by our target audience. On the &ldquo;military might&rdquo; narrative for instance, the organization <a href="http://www.truthaboutisis.com">Truth About ISIS</a>, proved to be a good source of videos highlighting ISIS&rsquo;s military setbacks.</p>
