            <h2><em>What did we do?</em></h2>
            <p>We needed to organize the best online videos from the research into <strong>“Playlists”</strong> <span class="info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A 'playlist' in YouTube is a list, or group, of videos that plays in order, one video after the other. When one video finishes playing, the next starts automatically so you don’t have to click or search to start playing a new video. Playlists can be created using your own videos, other videos, or a combination of both. YouTube playlists allow you to to organize videos into groups or themes. In the case of the Pilot, the playlist themes were the five ISIS’s recruitment narratives."></span> that can live on YouTube <strong>“Channels”</strong><span class="info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A 'channel' on YouTube is the home page for an account, a place for videos to be uploaded, and for playlists to live. In the case of the Pilot, there were two channels — one for the English-language and one for the Arabic-language campaigns."></span> Moonshot CVE & Quantum Communications created two YouTube channels, one in English, one in Arabic, to host themed playlists featuring a selection of the videos debunking ISIS recruiting narratives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              They sent a message through the platform to all the YouTube creators whose content was curated within a playlist to provide high level context about the Pilot and ensured that the ordering of the videos within each playlist made for a compelling storyline. For example:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In the playlist refuting the 'Good Governance' narrative, we started with a video depicting the general failure of ISIS governance, then built a flow by covering, food shortage, education, then healthcare -- so by the end of the playlist the user would get a 360 view of the hypocrisy of this branch of the ISIS messaging campaign.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the playlist refuting the 'Military Strength' narrative, we start with a couple of videos depicting the general losses of ISIS, then the second half of the playlist shows videos of the particular forces winning against ISIS; the Kurds, Iraqi Army, and Coalition forces.
              </li>
            </ul>
