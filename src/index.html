        <div class="content editable"><p>Violent extremist groups use the Internet to radicalize and recruit. We believe that the existing inventory of online videos along with advertising tools can be used to divert potential sympathizers away from the online recruiting efforts of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) and similar groups. This is a blueprint for how to do so, based on two recent pilot campaigns that together reached an estimate of 440,000 individuals seeking to engage with content promoting violent Islamism.</p><p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/pilot/">Learn about the Pilot</a></p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>The so-called Islamic State (ISIS) is the first terrorist group to have &ldquo;secured territory&rdquo; in both the physical and digital spheres. Which is why it has set up central media outlets&mdash;including Al-Furqan, Al-I'tisam, Al-Hayat, and Ajnad&mdash;to produce its flagship messaging. &nbsp;They have been able to pump out a steady stream of leadership statements, documentaries, and hostage and battlefield videos. The group also benefits from crowd-sourced efforts: loyalists who serve in the media as the poster-children for ISIS&rsquo;s campaigns (e.g., &ldquo;Jihadi John&rdquo;, Sally Jones), remote sympathisers who post supportive messages on social media (such as Shami Witness), and dedicated disseminators who share links from one content-hosting website to another. All of this forms a complex, reinforcing network of content and actors whose goal is to leverage the power of the Internet to recruit new adherents. The Redirect Method is a new approach to tackling violent extremism recruitment efforts online.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h1>What is the Redirect Method?</h1><p>But ISIS wouldn't be doing all of this if they didn't think that people were actively looking for it. And sadly there are too many doing so. This is the reality we're trying to interrupt through what we're calling the Redirect Method.&nbsp;<strong>The Redirect Method is a 4-step experiment that employs readily available online resources &mdash; existing online videos and targeted advertising tools</strong> &mdash; to counter ISIS recruitment efforts online, in an engaging, transparent and responsible way.</p><h2>Four guiding principles have shaped this project and made it different from most other initiatives underway:</h2></div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="content editable"><p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/graphic-focus.svg" /></p><h2>Focus on those most susceptible to ISIS&rsquo; messaging.</h2><p>Our experiment did not aim to change the general discourse around ISIS or violent Islamism in society. When considering our audience for this project, we envisioned the slice of ISIS&rsquo; audience that was most actively seeking to engage with ISIS-produced content. We started by speaking directly to those who had been recruited and convinced by ISIS rhetoric &mdash; both young girls who had aspired to be so-called ISIS-brides, and former ISIS fighters who had defected. These target audience insights were plugged into the advertising tools used by a million other advertisers every day.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="content editable"><p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/graphic-audience.svg" /></p><h2>Go where your audience is; they won't come to you.</h2><p>From our user interviews, we&rsquo;ve learned that an engaging experience for our target audience should feel organic; not preachy or agenda-driven. &nbsp;This principle guided each stage of the pilot&rsquo;s design and implementation.</p></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="content editable"><p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/graphic-content.svg" /></p><h2>Use existing authentic, credible content -- it's already out there.</h2><p>Online videos of citizen testimonies, on-the-ground reports, and key religious debates comprised the content portfolio; we intentionally avoided government-produced content. Debunking the conventional wisdom that compelling content doesn&rsquo;t exist online, we were able to run this project without relying on newly created material, using only existing YouTube content.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="content editable"><p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/graphic-transparency.svg" /></p><h2>Openness &amp; transparency will allow to improve and scale</h2><p>Our experiment was not designed to develop a definitive &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; guide, but rather to begin a collaborative process whereby those engaging ISIS and affiliated groups online can learn from one another and build on each other&rsquo;s successes. For this experiment, we&rsquo;ve relied on a diverse set of skills, perspectives and talents. Surely, we still have blind spots. We are releasing the story of our experiment, the data we have on how it performed, and blueprint of how to replicate the project. We leave it to others to build on it, continue the conversation, and improve this approach.</p></div>
