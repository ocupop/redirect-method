          <p class="editable">The Redirect Method uses Adwords targeting tools and curated YouTube videos uploaded by people all around the world to confront online radicalization. It focuses on the slice of ISIS’ audience that is most susceptible to its messaging, and redirects them towards curated YouTube videos debunking ISIS recruiting themes. This open methodology was developed from interviews with ISIS defectors, respects users’ privacy and can be deployed to tackle other types of violent recruiting discourses online.</p>

          <p class="editable">
            The so-called Islamic State (ISIS) is the first terrorist group to have “secured territory” in both the physical and digital sphere. It has set up central media outlets—including Al-Furqan, Al-I'tisam, Al-Hayat, and Ajnad—to craft its messaging. They have been able to produce a steady stream of leadership statements, documentaries, and videos of hostages and battlefields. ISIS also benefits from crowd-sourced efforts: loyalists serving as ISIS poster-children in the news (e.g., “Jihadi John”, Sally Jones), remote sympathisers posting supportive messages on social media (such as Shami Witness), and dedicated disseminators sharing links between content-hosting websites. All of this forms a complex, reinforcing network of content and actors whose goal is to leverage the power of the Internet to recruit new adherents.

            ISIS wouldn’t be deploying such efforts online if they didn’t think people were actively looking for content. And sadly there are too many doing so. We’ve built the Redirect Method to add to the arsenal of tools available to address this reality, to ensure that those browsing the Internet with precise questions around violent extremism and the Caliphate get answers from the many voices debunking ISIS recruitment narratives.

          <p class="editable">
            The Redirect Method is a 4-step approach that employs readily available online resources — existing online videos and targeted advertising tools — to counter ISIS recruitment efforts online.

          <h3 class="editable"><i>Our target audience:</i><br>Those most susceptible to ISIS’ messaging online.</h3>
          <p class="editable">
            We focused solely on reaching the slice of ISIS’ audience that was most susceptible to its message and actively seeking to engage with ISIS-produced content. We based the Redirect Method on insights from speaking directly to those who had been recruited and convinced by ISIS rhetoric — both young girls who had aspired to be so-called ISIS-brides, and former ISIS fighters who had defected.

          <p class="editable">
            To reach our target audience, we used the same tools used by a million advertisers every day to find their target audience: online advertising.

          <p class="editable">
            Online videos of citizen testimonies, on-the-ground reports, and religious debates comprised the content portfolio. We avoided government-produced content and newly or custom created material, using only existing and compelling YouTube content.
