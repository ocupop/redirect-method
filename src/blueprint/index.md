<h2>Campaign preparation</h2>
<ol>
   <li>
      <h3>Identify the problem you are trying to solve through a campaign</h3>
      <p>As a starting point, identify the problem you are confronting, and is key characteristics. During the pilot, the problem we identified was ISIS's ability to recruit through dissemination of particular myths, narratives, and calls to action.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Identify what you want achieve</h3>
      <p>Identify what needs to change to address the problem, and ensure you have a clear understanding of how a campaign will contribute to that change. Different campaigns have different desired outcomes. You may wish to undermine the ability of a group to recruit, you may wish to change the minds of people that have already joined or you may with to mobilise counter-activists against an extremist group. Having a clear aim is an essential component to a successful campaign.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Map the extremist content you’re trying to address</h3>
      <p>Many campaigns fail as they are based on assumptions rather than evidence. As such it is essential to map out the online content you are seeking to counter or undermine. For example, recruitment narratives are likely to change with regions, languages, targets, etc, so it is crucial in this step to engage experts on the type of extremism you are seeking to counter. It can be useful to begin the mapping process with pre-existing lists or databases of content online. In our case we found [Jihadology](http://jihadology.net)a useful starting point when mapping ISIS recruitment content. For far right extremism [resources](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch)maintained by the SPLC may prove helpful.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Analyze this content to map the main recruitment narratives</h3>
      <p>Each piece of content identified during step one should now be analysed and placed in the context of the broader extremist recruitment strategy. At this stage subject matter experts must be engaged in order to filter this content into a manageable selection of key narratives used by the extremist group. During the pilot we identified five key ISIS narratives. We found that engaging former extremists, defectors and security service personnel is a useful addition to engaging with academic experts in the field. The [Against Violent Extremism](http://www.againstviolentextremism.org) network allows organisations to connect with former extremists.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Gather content that counters the main narratives you’ve identified</h3>
      <p>Using your key narratives, start to gather video content that counters these narratives. In order to do this, use simple snowball sampling by searching for content countering your key narratives on Google and exploring available content. In addition to having researchers search for counter-content based on the key narratives, community activists and others should be engaged to make recommendations around effective content which may not be indexed accurately.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Create a database of your counter-arguments</h3>
      <p>Draw your counter-content into a database. Code this database by theme, content creator, video length, probable resonance with your target audience, production quality and any other factors which may be useful in the decision making process. As in previous steps, community activists and others should be engaged to make recommendations around the most effective content in this database.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h3>Select the videos you will use, start making possible playlists</h3>
      <p>Pick the best videos in your database. Sort them into possible playlists, with each playlist corresponding to a theme you have identified in step #2. It may not be the case that your channel benefits from being too closely associated with your subject matter. During the pilot we deliberately built a channel that appeared to be a generic content aggregation channel.</p>
