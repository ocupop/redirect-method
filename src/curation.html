        <h1>The pilot experiment that started it all.</h1>
        <p>User:Ayda is a pilot experiment we conducted between August 2015 and March 2016 to test a new approach to tackling violent extremism recruitment efforts online. The project relied on two advertising campaigns of 5 YouTube playlist each: the English campaign featured 51 videos, and the Arabic campaign # videos. Over the course of 8 weeks, together these two campaigns reached an estimate of 440,000 unique individuals.</p>

            <h1>What did we do?</h1>
            <p>We needed to organize the best online videos from the research into <a href="#">“Playlists”</a> that can live on YouTube <a href="">“Channels”</a> The ordering of the videos within each playlist reflected an intended storyline.</p>
            <h1>What did we learn?</h1>
            <p>There is plenty of existing and relevant video available online to support projects aiming to tackle online radicalization: X videos were watched for 475,603 minutes by Y individuals as a result of the campaign.</p>
            <p>The profiles of the curated content differed by language: While there was roughly equal amounts of Arabic and English religious content, the Arabic content tended to be more technical in nature.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is more English-language documentary material than Arabic, and</li>
              <li>There is a lot of defector material in both English and Arabic.</li>
              <li>The most evocative citizen journalism videos are in Arabic — and this was a relatively underpopulated category</li>
