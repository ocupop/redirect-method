            <h1>What did we do?</h1>
            <p>We needed to organize the best online videos from the research into <strong>“Playlists”</strong> <span class="info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A 'playlist' in YouTube is a list, or group, of videos that plays in order, one video after the other. When one video finishes playing, the next starts automatically so you don’t have to click or search to start playing a new video. Playlists can be created using your own videos, other videos, or a combination of both. YouTube playlists allow you to to organize videos into groups or themes. In the case of the Pilot, the playlist themes were the five ISIS’s recruitment narratives."></span> that can live on YouTube <strong>“Channels”</strong><span class="info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A 'channel' on YouTube is the home page for an account, a place for videos to be uploaded, and for playlists to live. In the case of the Pilot, there were two channels — one for the English-language and one for the Arabic-language campaigns."></span> Moonshot CVE and Quantum Communications created a YouTube channel in English and Arabic respectively, in which they created five playlists targeting each of the recruitment narratives we had identified.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the playlist refuting the 'Good Governance' narrative, we started with a video depicting the general failure of ISIS governance, then built a flow by covering, food shortage, education, then healthcare -- so by the end of the playlist the user would get a 360 view of the hypocrisy of this branch of the ISIS messaging campaign.</li>
              <li> In the playlist refuting the 'Military Strength' narrative, we start with a couple of videos depicting the general losses of ISIS, then the second half of the playlist shows videos of the particular forces winning against ISIS; the Kurds, Iraqi Army, and Coalition forces.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When considering how their YouTube channels should look and feel for visitors, Moonshot CVE and Quantum Communications principally wanted to avoid appearing moralistic or judgmental. This addresses  feedback in interviews with individuals who had once subscribed to ISIS’s ideology describing negative experiences of being “pushed” Government-sponsored content that they then dismissed. Other than that, Moonshot CVE and Quantum Communications decided on very different strategies to tackle design. </p>

            <p>There is plenty of existing and relevant video available online to support projects aiming to tackle online radicalization: X videos were watched for 475,603 minutes by Y individuals as a result of the campaign.</p>
            <p>The profiles of the curated content differed by language: While there was roughly equal amounts of Arabic and English religious content, the Arabic content tended to be more technical in nature.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is more English-language documentary material than Arabic, and</li>
              <li>There is a lot of defector material in both English and Arabic.</li>
              <li>The most evocative citizen journalism videos are in Arabic — and this was a relatively underpopulated category</li>
