            <h2><em>Which online videos effectively discredit ISIS, and violent Islamism more generally, to an audience of potential sympathizers?</em></h2>
            <h1>What did we do?</h1>
            <p>We focused the research on a slice of ISIS’s audience that appeared particularly susceptible to the group’s message. We learned from interviews with ISIS defectors and failed aspirants — men, women and children — that all information sources do not carry equal weight. Media created by governments or Western news outlets is often rejected on face value because it is assumed to be promoting an anti-Muslim agenda.</p>
            <p>We worked with several research partners with knowledge of ISIS’s worldview and online materials to do two things:</p>

            <p>The focus of the research was on seeking out videos that appeared to be neutral in intention--including documentaries or citizen journalist footage that portray the world as the creators found it, rather than materials that appear specifically designed to counter ISIS. To get there, we used keyword searches to identify “hidden” counter-argument content -- that is, videos that are not necessarily well known, and often that were not designed with the explicit intention of refuting ISIS</p>
            <p>We also found that video content featuring prominent individuals whose contributions deliberately contradict ISIS’s messaging were also helpful.</p>

            <p><em>Content that effectively undermines ISIS does not always overtly attack ISIS.</em></p>
            <p>We looked for voices that will convey a sense of credibility and authenticity to our target audience. We determined that, given our specific goals and audience in mind, four major categories of credible, authentic voices existed</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Citizen Journalism Videos</strong> News content created by members of the general population. This includes videos by those who reside in ISIS-controlled territory who document ISIS’s atrocities and failed governance efforts.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Documentary Footage</strong> Content produced by documentarians and journalists. This material can, for example, highlight the poor quality of life in the caliphate, and draw attention to the group’s violence against civilians.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Religious Debate</strong> Videos featuring clerics and other religious figures who refute violent extremist narratives, and seek to undercut ISIS’s religious legitimacy.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ISIS Defectors</strong> Videos highlighting the testimonies of ISIS defectors whose actual experiences undercut ISIS’s recruitment narratives, and reveal the group’s shortcomings and hypocrisy.

            <p><em>Campaigns to confront online extremism don’t necessitate new content creation.</em></p>
            <p>The best part of the research — beyond identifying ISIS’s recruiting narratives and the content categories most likely to debunk them — was that it surfaced hundreds of online videos already uploaded to YouTube, that would not be be rejected outright by our target audience.</p>
