          <h2><em>How can we measure the performance of the campaign? What does data tell us about which bits and pieces are the most effective?</em></h2>
          <h1>What did we do?</h1>
          <p>We chose to track metrics that will tell us how many people our campaigns reached, if our content successfully engaged the target audience, and what were the most and least successful elements of our experiment. There aren’t a lot of similar metrics that we can compare and contrast our data with: we hope that by sharing our results, we will encourage others to also do so, and will lead to others sharing similar data, building benchmarks, and sharing best practices to optimize campaigns.</p>
          <p>We used campaign metrics provided by AdWords, and Youtube Analytics, along with third party research vendor Tubular Labs who were offering methodologies to measure impact by looking at the public comments under the YouTube videos included in the campaign. We used metrics to answer four simple questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How many people from our target audience did the campaigns reach?</strong> These are called Reach metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Did they watch the videos, and engage with the playlists?</strong> These are called Engagement metrics and they help us understand if we managed to make our campaign relevant and engaging for the target audience, or if they just glanced over it and moved on to other online activities.</li>
            <li><strong>What did people think about the content?</strong> That’s obviously the hardest question to answer, but we assumed that the comments under the video would give us a clue or two about people’s reactions to the videos.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>What were the better performing elements of our campaign?</strong> What worked best, what didn’t? We also used these analytics to build best practices and refine our experiment and methodology.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>What did we learn?</h1>
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase">REACH |</strong> We chose to gauge the reach of our campaigns by the number of unique users who ‘clicked’ on the ads, not just ‘saw’ them. The campaigns reached 440,000 Estimated Unique Users who chose to click on our ads across the different touchpoints of the campaign: Search, Google Display Network. Est. 243,924 unique clickers from the Arabic campaign, and 194,371 unique clickers from the English campaign</p>
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase">ENGAGEMENT |</strong> Click Through Rate is one of the most widely used online advertising metrics to gauge campaigns’ engagement. It’s a ratio showing how often people who see an ad end up clicking it. Given the niche objective of our campaigns, Advocacy is the closest sector we could find to benchmark our campaigns type against. Wordstream reports that for Avg. CTR for Advocacy Search campaigns is 1.72%, and 0.52% Avg. CTR for Advocacy Google Display Network Campaigns.</p>
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase">DATA |</strong> What did this data teach us about our methodology? We reached our target audience! Lessons learned about optimization:<br>
          Lessons learned about keywords: stronger CTR for lower down the funnel<br>
          Lessons learned about narratives: better avg. time in playlist</p>

          <h2><em>What questions should we be asking ourselves to ensure success to the desired final destination: behaviour change?</em></h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Do I have the right search terms?</strong> If the search terms you are advertising against are not representative of your target audience's behaviour then your campaign will struggle to engage this audience. When seeking to measure the effectiveness of your search terms, your ‘search impression share’ is the clearest indication of success. Only when you measure and maximise your search impression share can you be sure that you are truly safeguarding your audience in your chosen location.</li>
            <li><strong>Are my ads resonating?</strong> If you have a well researched list of keywords and a high search impression share, but no one clicks on your ads, then your campaign will fail to achieve its goals. A campaign using The Rami Method must measure the click through rate (CTR) of the served ads in order to asses the effectiveness of different ad types. The English pilot involved over 150 unique ads, each designed to engage a certain audience type.</li>
            <li><strong>Is my content resonating?</strong> Once users have clicked on an ad and have been directed towards the curated content, they are not obliged to stay. The ability of the content to engage and hold the user's attention is crucial. This can be measured by examining and increasing the average time in playlist, as well as the view through rates on trailers if applicable. You may want to test the impact of re-ordering your playlist content or adding additional content to your playlist, on the average time in playlist.</li>
            <li><strong>Has behaviour changed?</strong> The ultimate aim of The Rami Method is to change the behaviour of those users engaging with your content. The user journeys of YouTube users that engage with content on your playlist can be measured by assessing their viewing patterns before and after coming into contact with your playlists.</li>
